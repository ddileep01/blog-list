      Hello, I am Dileep from Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh, India. I did my
      Bachelors of Technology at Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge and
      Technologies in 2022 in the Mechanical Engineering stream. However, I have
      now shifted to the IT field as a result of the boom in the software
      industry and also my interest in developing web applications to make
      peoples lives easier. Now I am doing my MERN specialization in Full Stack
      Development at NxtWave C.C.B.P and my UX professional certification on
      Coursera from Google Career Certificates. I have 3 years of experience in
      design with good knowledge of the Adobe Creative Suite by doing some
      various projects in my college days. I know front-end technologies like
      HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and React.js, and back-end technologies
      like Python, Express, Node.js, and databases like SQLite and MongoDB. I
      use figma for UI and I also have knowledge of UX research. I worked on
      many projects in Full Stack Development by spending 150 million minutes
      learning to code. I love to code and design products.
